                <h2>Introduce the project</h2>
                <p>The Desktop Companion device is a health monitoring accessory that uses biometrics
                    to offer a more comfortable and productive desk experience. By building a device 
                    that would compact specific add-ons into one, it will eliminate the need to buy
                    other multiple extensions that would be too costly and take up desk space. Some
                    features include facial recognition for seamless login and gesture controls for
                    activating hotkey functions to optimize workflow efficiency. This project was 
                    selected because we aim to design a compact device that will monitor the user’s health while 
                    providing the necessary feedback to improve productivity as the user is working at their desk.
                     We are excited to do this, because we want to develop an accessory that engages with the user
                      while monitoring their health.</p>

                <h2> What made this project special</h2>
                <p> The Desktop Companion is a LCD accessory for a Windows computer. It’s designed to monitor the
                    user’s health by observing the user’s temperature and facial expressions by providing real time
                    AI feedback based on that. The companion will also promote productivity with its widgets, activity
                    tracker, and hand gesture control. Productivity is promoted with macros to control their desktop,
                    real time feedback in regards to their activity level on the computer, and being able to tab between
                    desktops with hand swipes. The companion’s widgets serve as hotkeys, or macros, so the user can open
                    and minimize applications, control their media with media keys, and more. The companion’s activity
                    tracker software will monitor metrics, such as daily keystrokes and clicks. This software will not 
                    store sensitive data, such as credentials, passwords, and etc. Lastly, the companion’s hand gesture
                    software is used to detect hand swipes, and tab between the left and right desktop based on that. 
                    All of these features are designed to make the user have a more comfortable experience at their desk.

                <h2> Widgets</h2>
                <p>The first features we developed is created unique widgets that completely separate with Stream-desk 
                    from the market. Our measures of success for this demo were to be able to customize the hotkeys on
                     the Companion, and to use the hotkeys from the Companion and have them be executed on the computer.
                      For this to be possible, we had to set up a socket communication between both the computer and the
                       Companion. During our live demo, we first demonstrated our media keys, showing that we were able 
                       to control our music on the computer from the Companion. We also demonstrated the many applications
                        that could be opened on the computer, such as slack, spotify, teams, text editors, and more. 
                        Lastly, we demonstrated the user interface and how to customize, add, and remove hotkeys from
                         the Companion.

                <h2> Health Monitor feature</h2>
                <p>After we finished the widgets, we implemented the 2nd microcontroller for the health monitoring features
                   Our first measure of success for this demo was to be able to relay the user’s temperature and
                    provide feedback based on their temperature. Our second measure of success for this demo was to 
                    be able to measure the user’s activity level by measuring metrics such as daily keystrokes, daily 
                    clicks, total keystrokes, and total clicks and provide feedback based on that. During our demo,
                    we provided videos of the Companion measuring different temperature ranges. The Companion was
                    able to record both average human temperature and when the user can potentially have a fever.
                    For the average human temperature, the Companion notified the user that their temperature was good.
                    When a high temperature range was recorded, the Companion notified the user that they could
                    potentially have a fever. For our activity tracker, we were able to show the Companion 
                    consistently providing real time updates as the user’s daily activity increased.
                    Additionally, we were also to show and explain why sensitive data isn’t recorded with the
                    software.

                <h2> Hand Gesture feature</h2>
                <p>
                    The last feature of this project was combination of motion captures.
                    we demonstrated the Companion reacting to the user’s facial expressions and the Companion providing
                    real time updates based on that. We also showed our lock feature, by having the user walk out of
                    the camera’s frame and locking the computer after 10 seconds had elapsed. For our hand gesture
                    control, we showed a simulation of our program capturing hand swipes and displaying whether
                    it was a left or right hand swipe. We also showed the Companion switching between desktops 
                    based on the hand swipe. Lastly, we were able to show an unified system by successfully 
                    demonstrating every feature in one go.
