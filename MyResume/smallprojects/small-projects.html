        <h1>Welcome to my Small Projects Page</h1>
        <p>This is where my journey began—through hands-on exploration of concepts learned both in
             the classroom and through self-driven passion projects. 
             These small-scale initiatives laid the foundation for my growth in engineering and technology.</p>

                <h2>Line Following Car – The Beginning of My Embedded Systems Journey</h2>
                <p>I began with fundamental concepts of Computer Engineering, applying digital electronics to develop
                    a basic line-following car. This project marked the starting point of my embedded systems career,
                    providing a practical understanding of how computers operate using binary logic (TRUE/FALSE states).
                    I implemented infrared (IR) sensors in conjunction with operational amplifiers (op-amps) to realize 
                    basic gate logic and control the car’s navigation along a defined path.
                    This project taught me how to design a schematic with KiCad or EasyIDE or with autoCAD</p>

                <h2> Spaceship game</h2>
                <p> During my academic studies, I developed a solid foundation in C/C++ programming.
                    As a practical application of my skills, I designed and implemented a simple space
                    shooter game using C++. In this project, the Nokia 5110 LCD was used to display a 
                    simplified version of the classic Space Invaders game. A 10 Hz screen refresh rate 
                    was achieved using the SysTick timer, demonstrating the use of periodic interrupts 
                    for consistent display updates. The system operated on an 80 MHz clock, configured 
                    through the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), ensuring high-speed performance for real-time 
                    processing. To enable user interaction, an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) was 
                    implemented to continuously sample input voltages, allowing smooth control of the 
                    player's spaceship based on analog input signals. This project illustrates practical 
                    applications of timers, clock systems, and ADCs in embedded system design for interactive applications.

                <h2> Real-time distance measuring with Ultrasound sensor</h2>
                <p>After graduating, I dedicated time to further explore the field of embedded systems. In this project,
                    I implemented a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for the first time, utilizing the SEGGER SystemView
                    tool to monitor task execution. I designed a multitasking environment integrated with I2C communication
                    and customized the clock settings for the OLED display to enable real-time data updates from the 
                    master microcontroller. This project allowed me to gain practical experience with both RTOS-based 
                    task management and I2C communication protocols.</p>
