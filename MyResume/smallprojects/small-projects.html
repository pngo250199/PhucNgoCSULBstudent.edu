        <h1>Welcome to my Small Projects Page</h1>
        <p>This is where my journey began—through hands-on exploration of concepts learned both in
             the classroom and through self-driven passion projects. 
             These small-scale initiatives laid the foundation for my growth in engineering and technology.</p>

                <h2>Line Following Car – The Beginning of My Embedded Systems Journey</h2>
                <p>I began with fundamental concepts of Computer Engineering, applying digital electronics to develop
                    a basic line-following car. This project marked the starting point of my embedded systems career,
                    providing a practical understanding of how computers operate using binary logic (TRUE/FALSE states).
                    I implemented infrared (IR) sensors in conjunction with operational amplifiers (op-amps) to realize 
                    basic gate logic and control the car’s navigation along a defined path.
                    This project taught me how to design a schematic with KiCad or EasyIDE or with autoCAD</p>

                <p>After graduating, I dedicated time to further explore the field of embedded systems. In this project,
                    I implemented a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) for the first time, utilizing the SEGGER SystemView
                    tool to monitor task execution. I designed a multitasking environment integrated with I2C communication
                    and customized the clock settings for the OLED display to enable real-time data updates from the 
                    master microcontroller. This project allowed me to gain practical experience with both RTOS-based 
                    task management and I2C communication protocols.</p>
